            <h1>Rule an Ancient City</h1>

            <p>
                <b>Towers and Temples</b> is the winner of the 2017 Palmer 
                Medal for Best New Simulation Board Game. 
                Players adopt role cards of characters from ancient 
                Greece and Rome in an attempt to manage 
                the administration of a city. Each role provides 
                a different ability and strategy. However, 
                one role card belongs to a deadly assassin and players 
                must be constantly aware of betrayal 
                and double-cross. This card game provides a ton 
                of enjoyment and can handle up to eight players 
                and expansion packs available for larger parties.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is a nicely balanced game, where each player must 
                carefully choose his or her roles and 
                the strategies can quickly change with the turn 
                of a card. However the level of randomness is 
                just right and cunning and resourcefulness can 
                overcome bad luck (if given time.) I do not 
                recommend this game unless there are at least 4 
                players; less than that reduces the intrigue 
                and some of the game appeal.

                    <b>Towers and Temples</b> is a great game. The balance is 
                    just about perfect and each player must 
                    carefully choose roles each turn. Even though the 
                    strategic possibilities are nearly endless, 
                    the game is simple to learn. The replay value is 
                    high and gets even better when you replace 
                    some of the cards with new cards available in the 
                    expansion packs.

                <ol><h1>Great Strategic Board Game</h1></ol>

                <ol>
                    We tested Towers and Temples with everything from 2 
                    to 6 players and we can strongly 
                    recommend the game. The different phases of the 
                    game are interesting and intriguing, from
                    bluffing and stealing to site construction and planning. 
                    With the variety of cards and 
                    scenarios, no two games are ever quite the same. It's 
                    a great introduction to the world of 
                    strategic board games and role playing.

                <ol><h1>An Incredible Game</h1></ol>

                <ol>
                    The artwork on the cards and the board is excellent 
                    and one of the best around. As 
                    for play, this game offers lots of strategy, and there 
                    are tough decisions to make every 
                    turn. It's not only important to select the character 
                    that increases your chances for scoring, 
                    but also to anticipate the characters the opponents 
                    are likely to select, and then hedge against 
                    their availability. This causes a lot of unpredictability 
                    and deep strategic thinking. However, 
                    it can still be played at a more basic level for 
                    younger users.
                </ol>

                <ol>
                    We had a lot of fun with this game and rate it as 
                    <b><i>Best in its Class</i></b>. Highly recommended.
